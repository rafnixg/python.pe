### ¿Tienes algún aporte a la comunidad de Python?

1. 📢 Promoter of Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS)
I am deeply committed to using and promoting free and open-source technologies. I actively advocate for the adoption of FOSS—especially Python-based solutions like Odoo—in the organizations I work with. My philosophy is to share knowledge and rely on open-source tools to build robust systems.

2. 🧠 Knowledge Sharing and Mentoring
I contribute by investing in future talent and sharing expertise:

Mentoring: As a Senior Python/Odoo Developer, I provided technical mentoring and training to Junior and Trainee team members, directly helping to develop skills within the Python/Odoo ecosystem.

Technical Writing: I contribute valuable documentation and tutorials, such as blog posts detailing:

How to automate Python package libraries on PyPI using GitHub Actions.

A step-by-step guide on publishing your own Python library.

Advanced operations and environment configuration for Odoo/Python development (e.g., using VSCode or the Odoo CLI shell).

3. 🛠️ Open-Source Projects (GitHub)
I contribute code through public repositories on my GitHub profile, demonstrating practical application of Python:

BCV Exchange Rate API (bcv-api): A public API project written in Python to retrieve the exchange rate from the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV).

Personal Utility Projects: Includes various small projects utilizing Python, such as the implementation of a basic HTTP server, showcasing foundational programming skills.

Odoo Development Environments: I provide publicly available configurations to help other developers set up and streamline their Odoo development environments using tools like VSCode.

### ¿Estás disponible para hacer mentoring, consultorías, charlas?

Yes, I am open to discussing opportunities for mentoring, consulting, and technical talks, especially in areas related to Backend Python Development, Odoo ERP, and DevOps practices.
